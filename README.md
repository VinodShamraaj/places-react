# Google Autocomplete App

This is a simple React app built with Create React App (CRA). It integrates with Google Maps API and displays some interactive features on the page.

## Requirements

1. **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.
2. A **Google Maps API key** for the app to work with Google Maps.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory and add your Google API key:

   ```
   REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here
   ```

   Replace `your-google-api-key-here` with your actual Google API key.

## Running the App

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Notes

- Make sure your Google API key is enabled for the necessary APIs (like Maps JavaScript API).
- For any issues, check the console for errors or refer to the Google Maps API documentation.

This README includes all the necessary steps for setting up the app and highlights the need for the Google API key in the `.env` file. You can customize it further based on your project needs.
